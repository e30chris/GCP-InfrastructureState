## Infrastructure Homework

_Notes:_

> The brief asked for an application/API to be coded.  As an infrastructure engineer, my coding expertise is in Terraform that hosts the application code, not the app code itself.  To highlight my thinking around infrastructure-as-code and the Terraform code that is the desired state of the infrastructure, I will complete the homework as an Ops team engineer who is responsible for the infrastructure code.
> I would like to add additional thoughts to the brief around the discipline of coding from an application and infrastructure point of view.
> Using Boeing as the scenario (787 specifically), we have engineers that design the wing structures and we have engineers that assemble the wing structures.  

> * Both engineers are the worlds leading knowledge holders on Boeing 787 wing structures. 
> * Neither engineer would be able to do the others skillset.
> * The wing structure engineer uses computers to design, engineer, test, and ship the plans to build the wings.
> * The wing assembly engineer uses tools to prepare, assemble, fasten, test, and ship the assembled wings.
> * The wing structure engineer could not use the tools of the assembly engineer as effectively as the that engineer can.
> * The wing assembly engineer could not use the computers of the structure engineer as effectinvely as that engineer can.
> * Although both engineers are equally knowledgeable on the wing structure of the 787 they should not attempt to do each others jobs and instead should focus on their skillset and tooling set that gets the best wing built and shipped to the customers.
